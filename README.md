# Warzone

Warzone is a command-line based board game inspired by the classic game of Risk. Developed in C++, it offers a strategic gameplay experience where players compete to conquer territories, form alliances, and outmaneuver their opponents to dominate the map.

The developed program will have to be compatible with the rules and map files and the command-line play of the “Warzone” version of
Risk, which can be found at: https://www.warzone.com/. A Warzone game setup consists of a connected graph
map representing a world map, where each node is a territory and each edge represents adjacency between
territories. Two or more players can play by placing armies on territories they own, from which they can attack
adjacent territories to conquer them. The objective of the game is to conquer all territories on the map. 

## Installation

To play Warzone, you'll need a C++ compiler and standard libraries installed on your system.
